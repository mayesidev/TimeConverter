This is a list of TODOs/general improvement notes:

0. Add column headers to advanced form to distinguish "columns".
1. Add a menu option to switch between regular (single) and advanced (3-column) forms.
2. Refactor initial UI implementation into a control (instead of a form).
3. Make a better way to add/remove controls on a form at-will (replacing fixed 3-column version with dynamic version).
